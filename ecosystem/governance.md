## Overview

Holdr Governance is the heart and brain of Holdr Protocol.

Anyone can be part of the Holdr Governance Process, and anyone with HLDR voting power can vote on proposals. Governance makes decisions about new features and directions of where the Holdr Protocol should go. Governance is the ultimate decision body for the Holdr Protocol; no one can override vote results.

## HOLDR Governance Token

Voting power for the Holdr Protocol is derived from the Holdr Governance Token (HLDR). HLDR holders vote on proposals relevant to the protocol. These proposals are wide ranging, from Governable Protocol Fees to how HLDR Tokens themselves are distributed into the future.
