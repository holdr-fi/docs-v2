# How To Use veHLDR

## Acquiring veHLDR

{% hint style="warning" %}
**One account cannot hold distinct chunks of locked veHLDR with different expiration dates**.

If you lock additional HPT to increase an existing veHLDR balance, you must also choose a new expiration date for your total veHLDR balance. The earliest option is the original expiration date.
{% endhint %}

To acquire veHLDR, you'll need to do the following:

* Provide liquidity to the the 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR pool on Aurora

* Stake the 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR HPT to get veHLDR
  * In doing so, you'll need to choose your lock period. The longer you lock, the more veHLDR voting power/weighting you get, but the longer you must wait to unlock your HPT

## Extending veHLDR Lock Period

* To extend your lock time, go to the veHLDR page and follow the same process as locking your 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR HPT; this time, however, you do not need provide additional 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR HPT; instead, enter a later date in the calendar selector to extend your lock period and acquire more veHLDR.

## Reclaiming Your HPT/wNEAR HPT

On the veHLDR page, click the (-) icon in the "My locked 80HLDR-20wNEAR" box to start unlocking your HPT from expired veHLDR.
