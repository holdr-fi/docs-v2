# veHLDR

## Overview

veHLDR (vote-escrow HLDR) is a vesting and yield system based on [Curveâ€™s veCRV mechanism](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html).

{% hint style="info" %}
For those unfamiliar with Curve's system, users obtain veCRV by locking CRV in their `VotingEscrow` contract. veCRV is non-transferable, and its voting power decays linearly with time.
