## Overview

Liquidity Mining distributions are available to claim weekly through the [`MerkleOrchard`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/346ffdc995b709df2bd9e66f4e15ca22b2fc2c94/pkg/distributors/contracts/MerkleOrchard.sol) contract. Liquidity Providers can claim tokens from this contract by submitting claims to the tokens. These claims are checked against a Merkle root of the accrued token balances which are stored in a Merkle tree. Claiming through the MerkleOrchard is much more gas-efficient than the previous generation of claiming contracts, especially when claiming multiple weeks of rewards, and when claiming multiple tokens.

A Merkle tree is a data structure that makes it easy to check data validity, in this case token balances. On each level of a balanced binary tree, elements are hashed together so it’s possible to verify that data exists in the tree by submitting hashes from leaf to root, a “Merkle Proof”.
